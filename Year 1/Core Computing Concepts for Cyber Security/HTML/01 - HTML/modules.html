    <h2>Architecture and Operating Systems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This module is all about how the <strong>computer processes data</strong>, such as the <strong>binary system</strong> which is the basis
            of everything the computer does.
        </li>
        <li>
            We then look at the ways that the <strong>operating system</strong> is able to interact with the computer and the various devices which
            are connected to it such as a keyboard and mouse.
        </li>
    </ul>

<section id="CoreComputingConceptsForCyberSecurity">
    <h2>Core Computing Concepts For Cyber Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In this module we look at some key areas in computing which will help with the course.</li>
        <li>These four parts are a literature review of AI and the effects that it has on people in their everyday lives.</li>
        <li>The second is taking a look at web development and making use of <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> to make interactive websites.</li>
        <li>
            The third is some of the core security concepts such as <strong>cryptography and access control</strong> which is directly linked to the
            course.
        </li>
        <li>
            The last part is key concepts of <strong>usability</strong> which will look at how we can make programs that are
            <strong>easy to use</strong> for a variety of people including those with disabilities.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="CyberSecurityAndForensicEssentials">
    <h2>Cyber Security And Forensic Essentials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This module has two parts, the cyber security part and digital forensics part.</li>
        <li>
            For the cyber security part we look at the different <strong>threats</strong> which computers may be subject to, making use of
            <strong>linux</strong> to do this.
        </li>
        <li>
            The computer forensics part involves looking at how we can carry out <strong>investigations</strong> to devices which might have been used
            in criminal activity.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="Programming">
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This module is all about developing your <strong>programming skills</strong> in Python. Part of this is making sure that you get into good
            habits in order to make sure that the code is <strong>logical and efficient</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            We start of by creating <strong>simple functions</strong> that do basic things such as getting user inputs, doing something with the
            inputs and then outputting it to the user.
        </li>
        <li>Later on in the year we will also be learning the Dart programming language as well.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="SystemAdministrationAndInternetworking">
    <h2>System Administration and Internetworking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This module is all about understanding how networking works within small businesses with a few computers, running both
            <strong>Windows and Linux</strong> operating systems.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will be creating multiple <strong>virtual machines</strong> within themself and networking them together so that they can
            <strong>communicate</strong> with each other and have access to the internet.
        </li>
    </ul>
